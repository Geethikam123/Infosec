# Theory concepts

## Security through Obscurity (STO)

• It is a cybersecurity approach to keep details like vulnerabilities safe from attackers.
<br>
• It adds a layer of complexity to the attack process.

### How it works?

• Sensitive information like source code, passwords confidential.
<br>
• It misleads file paths and decoys elements to divert attackers.

### Potential risks

• Not a standalone: If only STO is used, attackers can exploit vulnerabilities once they are exposed.
<br>
• Maintaining secrecy over time is difficult.
<br>
• Skilled attackers use sophisticated methods to breach defences.

### Mitigation of risks

• Use STO as a technique rather than architecture alone by using implementing Multi-Factor Authentication systems.
<br>
• Segmenting network into secure zones to prevent breaches.
<br>
• Regular security audits and software updates and reduce the risk.

## Attack Surface

• It refers to all the possible entry points and vulnerabilities through which an attacker can exploit.
<br>
• There are three components of an attack surface through which a network can be targetted:-

1. Physical attack surface: Occurs through endpoint devices like USB ports and laptops.
2. Digital attack surface: Includes networks and services like ports, codes and wireless connections.
3. Social engineering attack surface: Involves targeting people like employees through phishing or ransomware attempts.
